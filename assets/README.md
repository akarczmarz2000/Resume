#Resume - Armand J O Karczmarz

##Intial Commit
This was the first commit completed with the essential boilerplate had been added to the website.

##v0.1 - Header Complete
In this version, the header has been completed. The header has been styled by splitting it into the appropriate section, one section with a photo and the other more significant part with the name of the customer and their title.
Underneath the title and name, there is another section which is the navigation bar; this has also been styled in a wanted manner. The links currently work, but there is no content on the other pages.
The image that has been added in will be used as a logo across the website; therefore, it has been linked to direct to the home page.
The colours chosen are meant to sperate each area, the different shades of green to distinguish the header changeâ€”the colours of the navigation text and the navigation boxes were chosen to complement each other.
Also, animation has been added to the navigation boxes which is working well, but a fade-in animation is also added to the logo, and it isn't working in this current version.

##v0.2 - Footer Complete
In this version, a footer has been added.
In this footer, there is an about section which is a condensed version of the information on the about page.
There is also a download section which like the navigation download link is connected to a traditional version of a CV.
Finally, there is a social section which icons which will link to the customers' social profiles.

##v0.3 - Personal Section Complete
In this section is all the information relevant to contacting the customer clearly and well presented on the home screen underneath the customers' photo.

##v0.4 - Resume Page Complete
In this version, the header and footer from the home page were imported.
Then the page was divided into three sections; the first was a work history section, the second was a front-end development section, and the third was about back-end development.
The work history section has a timeline going down the page that displays the past companies they have worked for, the job titles while working there and the time they worked there.
The second section explains a little about what their front-end development skills do; the third does the same for back-end development.
Finally on this page is a progress bar of how good they are at each coding language in comparison to the other languages they know.
