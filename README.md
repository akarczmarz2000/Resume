# Resume - Armand J O Karczmarz - v0.61 README.md Written Up

This site is designed to show my coding skills in the website itself and it's different features. 
Then the information on the page will detail my previous work, my interests, my skill, a way to contact me and finally a downloadable CV.\
To help convey the information I will install a map that shows the different locations of the conferences and meetups I have attended. 
An email, with the required details to get back in touch with potential employers, will be sent from contact page through a contact form.
My previous work will be show through a link to my github repositories, I would like it to be displayed on the page itself but it maybe a link to my github.\
Finally I hope to design the page layout and colour scheme to show my skill in this department to engage employers and other people interests in my work.
